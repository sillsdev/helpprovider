## Working on UI related files

This project uses SDK style .csproj files which don't allow the Designer to be used in Visual Studio 2017.
There is a `Vulcan.Uczniowie.HelpProvider-Designer.csproj` file which uses the old .csproj style and thus
allows the programmer to edit the files with the Designer in Visual Studio 2017.
